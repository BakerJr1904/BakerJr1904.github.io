# Mars Convention
This is a fictional website about a mars convention. Mars conventions do happen, just this a fake one to practice my  skills with HTML and CSS. I would love to know what you think. I know everyone's time is valuable, and I thank you for giving some to me. This fictional convention takes place in San Antonio, TX. I actually would go to mars if given the chance, so if you know anyone that could help me get there please, help a brother out 🤣😂🤣
### My favorite things to do are: 👨‍💻
I love to code in many languages HTML, CSS, Ruby, Python 🐍<br/>
I also love to make FLASK apps. I spend my day thinking about new ways to use data science to help businesses out.<br/>
I have a bunch of new flask apps using Python and data science coming your way.<br/>
### Application Scanner
It's actually done and being used on a website, I just need to customize it for a Flask App <br/>
It actually takes a resume and compares it to a job description - to see how likely you will be interviewed.
### Document Scanner
This unique project takes a real document, and compaires it to another document to tell you if it is real or fake.<br/>
Any document Driver's license, passport, identification... just about anything!!
